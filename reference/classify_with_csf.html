    <dl><dt>slope_smooth</dt>
<dd><p>logical. When steep slopes exist, set this parameter to TRUE to reduce
errors during post-processing.</p></dd>


<dt>class_threshold</dt>
<dd><p>scalar. The distance to the simulated cloth to classify a point cloud into ground
and non-ground. The default is 0.5.</p></dd>


<dt>cloth_resolution</dt>
<dd><p>scalar. The distance between particles in the cloth. This is usually set to the
average distance of the points in the point cloud. The default value is 0.5.</p></dd>


<dt>rigidness</dt>
<dd><p>integer. The rigidness of the cloth. 1 stands for very soft (to fit rugged
terrain), 2 stands for medium, and 3 stands for hard cloth (for flat terrain). The default is 1.</p></dd>


<dt>iterations</dt>
<dd><p>integer. Maximum iterations for simulating cloth. The default value is 500. Usually,
there is no need to change this value.</p></dd>


<dt>time_step</dt>
<dd><p>scalar. Time step when simulating the cloth under gravity. The default value
is 0.65. Usually, there is no need to change this value. It is suitable for most cases.</p></dd>


<dt>class</dt>
<dd><p>integer. The classification to attribute to the points. Usually 2 for ground points.</p></dd>
