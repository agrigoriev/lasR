# lasR 0.1.2 (2024-02-10)

- New: progress bar when reading the header of the files (`LAScatalog`) can be enabled with `progress = TRUE`

# lasR 0.1.1 (2024-02-08)

- Doc: Corrected the documentation for the argument `ncores` in `processor()`, which incorrectly mentioned that it was not supported.

- Fix: Corrected the reader progress bar display when reading a las file with a filter and a buffer.
- Fix: Fixed the overall progress bar, which was delayed by one file and was showing incorrect progress.
