\description{
This function prints useful information about LAS/LAZ files, including the file version, size,
bounding box, CRS, and more. When called without parameters, it returns a pipeline stage. For
convenience, it can also be called with the path to a file for immediate execution, which is likely
the most common use case (see examples).
}
\examples{
f <- system.file("extdata", "MixedConifer.las", package = "lasR")

# Return a pipeline stage
exec(info(), on = f)

# Convenient user-friendly usage
info(f)
