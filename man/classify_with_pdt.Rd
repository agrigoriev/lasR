\usage{
classify_with_pdt(
  distance = 1,
  angle = 15,
  res = 50,
  min_size = 0.1,
  class = 2L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{distance}{scalar. Iteration distance threshold (figure 3 in original paper)
errors during post-processing.}

\item{angle}{scalar. Iteration angle threshold (figure 3 in original paper). Use a smaller angle value
(close to 4.0) in flat terrain and a bigger value (close to 10.0)}

\item{res}{scalar. Resolution to search seed points.  Usually, there is no need to change this value.
It is suitable for most cases.}

\item{min_size}{scale. Minimum triangle size. The densification is be stopped if a triangle
is shorter than this limit. Usually, there is no need to change this value.
It is suitable for most cases.}

\item{class}{integer. The classification to attribute to the points. Usually 2 for ground points.}
}
\value{
This stage transforms the point cloud in the pipeline. It consequently returns nothing.

\description{
Classify points using a variation of the Progressive TIN densification by Axelsson (2000) (see references).
It classifies ground points by iteratively creating a triangulated surface model (TIN). The algorithm
starts by selecting local low points. It assumes at least one ground-level point in any given area
of e.g. 50m. The initial TIN model's triangles are mostly below ground, touching only at vertices.
In subsequent iterations, more points are added to better follow the true ground surface. Iteration
parameters determine point acceptance as ground. The iteration angle (e.g., 4.0 for flat terrain, 10.0
for mountainous terrain) controls the eagerness to classify points based on ground level variations.
Iteration distance prevents large upward jumps in the model, avoiding points in low vegetation or
on low buildings. The iteration angle can be reduced automatically, if the triangles become small.
This reduces the eagerness to classify more ground points inside small triangles and thus, avoids
unnecessary point density of the ground model. The iteration angle inside small triangles approaches
zero if the longest triangle edge is shorter than a given Edge length value. Furthermore, the iteration
can be stopped completely if triangle edges are shorter than a given limit.
